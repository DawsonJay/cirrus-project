# Cirrus Project - Weather Data Pool System

## Overview

A production-ready weather data collection system that efficiently populates a SQLite database with current weather and forecast data across Canada using the Open-Meteo API.

## Key Features

- **Reliable Batch Processing**: Uses fixed batch size of 200 coordinates (proven to work consistently)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 19,008 grid points across all of Canada
- **Real-time Data**: Current weather conditions and 5-day forecasts
- **Efficient API Usage**: Optimized to respect rate limits and minimize API calls
- **Production Ready**: Clean, maintainable code with proper error handling

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **BatchUpdater** (`app/services/batch_updater.py`)
   - Main production class for weather data collection
   - Handles both current weather and forecast updates
   - Uses reliable batch size of 200 coordinates
   - Stops gracefully on rate limits

2. **GridGenerator** (`app/services/grid_generator.py`)
   - Generates 19,008 coordinate points across Canada
   - 50km spacing for comprehensive coverage
   - Includes regional classification

3. **Database Schema** (`app/database/schema.sql`)
   - SQLite database with optimized indexes
   - Tables for grid points, current weather, forecasts, and alerts
   - Efficient querying for frontend/AI integration

4. **API Clients** (`app/services/`)
   - Open-Meteo client for primary weather data
   - Environment Canada client for alerts
   - OpenWeatherMap and Weather Unlocked for validation

## Usage

### Running the Data Pool System

```bash
# Test the complete system
python3 test_data_pool.py

# Expected output:
# - Grid populated with 19,008 points
# - Weather data updated in batches of 200
# - Rate limit handling (stops gracefully)
# - Real weather data populated
```

### Performance

- **Batch Size**: 200 coordinates (optimal for reliability)
- **Processing Speed**: ~1 second per batch
- **Total Coverage**: 19,008 points across Canada
- **Rate Limits**: Respects Open-Meteo limits (stops on 429 errors)
- **Data Quality**: Real-time temperatures, humidity, weather conditions

## Database Structure

### Grid Points
- 19,008 coordinate points across Canada
- 50km spacing for comprehensive coverage
- Regional classification (BC, AB, ON, QC, etc.)

### Current Weather
- Temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction
- Pressure, precipitation, cloud cover
- Weather codes and descriptions
- UV index and visibility

### Forecasts
- 5-day forecasts for each grid point
- Daily max/min temperatures
- Precipitation and wind data
- Weather conditions

## API Integration

### Primary Source: Open-Meteo
- Free, reliable weather API
- No authentication required
- Generous rate limits
- Comprehensive data coverage

### Secondary Sources
- Environment Canada (alerts)
- OpenWeatherMap (validation)
- Weather Unlocked (validation)

## Error Handling

- **Rate Limits**: Graceful handling of 429 errors
- **Payload Size**: Fixed batch size prevents 413 errors
- **Network Issues**: Proper exception handling
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data quality

## Next Steps

1. **Data Retrieval System**: Build API endpoints for frontend queries
2. **Periodic Updates**: Set up 15-minute update cycles
3. **Frontend Integration**: Connect to React frontend
4. **AI Integration**: Prepare data for predictive models

## Lessons Learned

- **Batch size 200 is optimal**: No calibration needed, reliable and efficient
- **Simple is better**: Complex error handling and calibration added unnecessary complexity
- **Rate limits are the main constraint**: System designed to handle this gracefully
- **Real data is different from test data**: Actual grid coordinates create different payload sizes
