# AI Wildfire Prediction System - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the complete plan for implementing an AI-powered wildfire prediction system using the Weather Data Service V2. The system will generate daily wildfire risk maps for Canada using historical weather data and machine learning.

## System Architecture

### Phase 1: Data Preparation
- **Weather Data Service**: Fetches and stores historical Canadian weather data (2015-2025)
- **Data Filtering**: Keep only wildfire-relevant parameters (TMAX, TMIN, PRCP, SNWD)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Railway (5GB limit, persistent storage)
- **Expected Size**: ~1.5-2GB (60-70% reduction from current 4.4GB)

### Phase 2: AI Model Training
- **Algorithm**: XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)
- **Training Data**: Historical weather data (2015-2024)
- **Features**: Temperature, precipitation, snow depth, seasonal patterns
- **Output**: Wildfire risk scores (0-100%)
- **Training**: One-time process (2-6 hours locally)

### Phase 3: Prediction Generation
- **Input**: Historical averages for each day (e.g., Jan 15 average from 2020-2024)
- **Process**: Load trained model → Calculate daily averages → Generate predictions
- **Output**: 365 daily wildfire risk maps for 2025
- **Format**: Geographic regions with color-coded risk levels

### Phase 4: Frontend Visualization
- **Technology**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with SVG maps
- **Features**: 
  - Interactive slider for daily navigation
  - Color scale: Light blue (safe) → Dark red (high risk)
  - Geographic coverage: All of Canada
- **Deployment**: Static hosting (Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages)

## Technical Implementation

### Data Requirements
**Essential Parameters:**
- `TMAX` - Maximum temperature (primary fire driver)
- `TMIN` - Minimum temperature (temperature range)
- `PRCP` - Precipitation (drought indicator)
- `SNWD` - Snow depth (winter snowpack affects summer risk)

**Geographic Coverage:**
- All Canadian weather stations (9,269 stations)
- Aggregated by provinces/climate zones for mapping

**Temporal Coverage:**
- Training: 2015-2024 (10 years)
- Predictions: 2025 (365 days)

### AI Model Details
**Algorithm**: XGBoost
- **Type**: Gradient Boosting
- **Input**: Weather parameters + temporal features
- **Output**: Risk score (0-100%)
- **Features**: 
  - Daily weather values
  - 7-day averages
  - 30-day averages
  - Seasonal indicators
  - Drought indices

**Training Process:**
1. Load historical weather data
2. Engineer features (averages, trends, seasonal patterns)
3. Train XGBoost model
4. Save model to file
5. Validate on test data

**Prediction Process:**
1. Load saved model
2. Calculate historical averages for each day
3. Generate risk predictions for all regions
4. Convert to color-coded map data
5. Save as static files for frontend

### Deployment Strategy
**Weather Data Service:**
- **Platform**: Railway Hobby Plan ($5/month)
- **Storage**: 5GB persistent volume
- **Purpose**: Serve historical data for prediction generation

**AI Model:**
- **Training**: Local development machine
- **Inference**: Local generation of 365 daily maps
- **Storage**: Static files (no ongoing compute needed)

**Frontend:**
- **Platform**: Static hosting (free)
- **Content**: Pre-generated maps + interactive slider
- **No backend**: Pure client-side application

## Resource Requirements

### Development Phase
- **CPU**: Modern laptop (4+ cores)
- **RAM**: 8GB+
- **Storage**: 10GB for data + model files
- **Time**: 2-6 hours for training

### Production Phase
- **Weather Service**: Railway Hobby Plan ($5/month)
- **Frontend**: Free static hosting
- **Total Cost**: $5/month (vs $20-25/month for full cloud AI)

### Data Size Optimization
**Current State:**
- All parameters: 4.4GB
- All stations: 9,269
- All dates: 2015-2025

**Optimized State:**
- Essential parameters only: ~1.5-2GB
- All stations: 9,269 (geographic coverage needed)
- All dates: 2015-2025 (temporal coverage needed)
