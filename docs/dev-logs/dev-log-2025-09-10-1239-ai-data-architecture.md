# Dev Log: AI Data Architecture Design
**Date**: 2025-09-10-1239 GMT  
**Project**: Cirrus Project  
**Topic**: AI Weather Prediction Data Architecture

## Overview
Major architectural decision session to design the data structure for AI-powered dangerous weather prediction. We've evolved from a simple current weather display system to a comprehensive 3D spatial-temporal data grid for training predictive AI models.

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. AI Purpose Clarification
- **Goal**: Predict dangerous weather events (wildfires, hail storms, severe weather)
- **Scope**: Canada-wide coverage with focus on public safety
- **Approach**: 3D data grid with spatial and temporal dimensions

### 2. 3D Data Grid Architecture
- **X, Y Dimensions**: Geographic coordinates (10,000 grid points across Canada)
- **Z Dimension**: Time slices (24-hour intervals)
- **Coverage**: ~32km spacing between points (1 point per 1,000 kmÂ²)
- **Resolution**: Daily data collection for sustainable API usage

### 3. Data Source Strategy
- **Primary API**: Open-Meteo GEM API (Canadian Meteorological Center)
- **Advantages**: 
  - Optimized for North America
  - Comprehensive weather parameters
  - Single API call provides all needed data
  - No additional cost for comprehensive data

### 4. Comprehensive Weather Parameters
**Basic Weather**: temperature, humidity, pressure, wind, precipitation  
**Advanced Weather**: CAPE (storm prediction), soil moisture (fire risk), atmospheric profiles  
**Critical for AI**: Multi-altitude wind data, soil conditions, solar radiation, cloud cover by altitude

### 5. Historical Data Strategy
- **Backfill Period**: 1 year (365 daily slices)
- **API Usage**: ~18,250 calls (well within 1M/month limit)
- **Rationale**: Captures full seasonal cycles while preserving API budget for ongoing updates

### 6. Storage Architecture
- **Database Schema**: 3D table with (latitude, longitude, timestamp) as primary key
- **Data Volume**: ~3.65M data points per year
- **Scalability**: Can increase point density or historical depth as needed

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Current Data Collection
- Update API client to collect all GEM parameters
- Implement daily data collection for all 10,000 points
- Establish continuous update system

### Phase 2: Historical Backfill
- Collect 1 year of historical data
- Build 3D data grid foundation
- Validate data quality and coverage

### Phase 3: AI Development
- Build spatial-temporal AI model
- Train on historical weather sequences
- Implement dangerous weather prediction algorithms

### Phase 4: Continuous Operation
- Daily updates to maintain current data
- Model retraining with new data
- Performance monitoring and improvement

## Portfolio Value
This architecture demonstrates:
- **Strategic Thinking**: Balancing data needs with API constraints
- **System Design**: Scalable 3D data architecture
- **AI Planning**: Comprehensive approach to training data collection
- **Technical Depth**: Understanding of weather prediction requirements

## Next Steps
1. Update current data collection to use comprehensive GEM parameters
2. Design database schema for 3D data storage
3. Implement historical data backfill system
4. Begin AI model architecture planning
