**Image**: `future-map-wireframe-highlighted-points.png`

## Design Elements

### Visual Style
- **Background**: Dark slate grey with futuristic, high-tech aesthetic
- **Map Style**: Simple wireframe with thin, light grey lines
- **Point Markers**: Bright, glowing green circular points
- **Typography**: Clean, modern fonts with layered text effects
- **Color Palette**: Dark greys, white text, vibrant green accents

### Layout Structure
- **Two-Column Layout**: 
  - Left: Text content and call-to-action
  - Right: Large map visualization
- **Header Navigation**: Top bar with social icons and navigation links
- **Clean Separation**: Clear distinction between content and visualization areas

### Map Design
- **Wireframe Lines**: Thin, light grey lines creating city grids/road networks
- **Subtle Glow**: Lines have a subtle glow effect for futuristic feel
- **Point Distribution**: Green glowing points scattered across the map
- **Clustering**: Some areas show higher density of points
- **Data Visualization**: Points suggest areas of high activity or data density

### Typography and Content
- **Layered Text**: "Future" in semi-transparent grey, "Map Design" in white
- **Descriptive Text**: Clear explanation of the service
- **Call-to-Action**: Bright green "GET STARTED" button
- **Navigation**: White text with green highlighting for active states

### Interactive Elements
- **Navigation Bar**: HOME, EVENTS, BLOGS, ABOUT with active state highlighting
- **Social Icons**: Facebook, Twitter, and other platform icons
- **User Profile**: Circular profile icon in header
- **CTA Button**: Prominent green button for user engagement

## What You Like About This Design

### Key Preferences

## Application to Cirrus Project

### Potential Adaptations
- **Weather Map**: Wireframe outline of Canada with weather data points
- **Risk Markers**: Glowing points showing weather risks, stations, or active events
- **Data Density**: Clustering of points in high-risk or high-activity areas
- **Futuristic Feel**: Modern, high-tech aesthetic for AI weather prediction

### Implementation Notes
- The wireframe style would work perfectly for weather maps
- Glowing points could represent weather stations, risk areas, or active weather events
- The futuristic aesthetic would emphasize the AI/ML nature of the system
- The clean layout would make weather information easy to understand
- The two-column structure could separate weather data from map visualization

### Weather-Specific Adaptations
- **Map Style**: Wireframe outline of Canada with provincial borders
- **Weather Points**: Glowing markers for:
  - Weather stations (blue glow)
  - Risk areas (red glow for high risk, yellow for medium, green for low)
  - Active weather events (pulsing glow for storms, fires, etc.)
- **Data Clustering**: Higher density of points in areas with more weather activity
- **Color Coding**: Different colored glows for different weather types
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects showing weather data for each point

### Technical Implementation
- **Leaflet Integration**: Custom map styling for wireframe appearance
- **CSS Effects**: Glow effects using box-shadow and filter properties
- **Data Visualization**: Dynamic point placement based on weather data
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure map and points scale properly on different screens
- **Animation**: Subtle pulsing or glowing effects for active weather events
