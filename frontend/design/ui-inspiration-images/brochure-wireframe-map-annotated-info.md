**Image**: `brochure-wireframe-map-annotated.jpg`

## Design Elements

### Visual Style
- **Background**: Dark muted teal color for sophisticated, calm backdrop
- **Map Style**: Wireframe with subtle contour lines giving topographic appearance
- **Outlines**: Thin white lines clearly defining country borders
- **Annotations**: Clear text labels for specific areas of interest
- **Connection Elements**: Dashed white line connecting marked locations

### Map Design
- **Wireframe Approach**: Clean, minimalist geographic representation
- **Contour Lines**: Faint, lighter teal lines creating elevation/texture effect
- **Highlighted Areas**: France and Poland clearly outlined in white
- **Point Markers**: White "X" marking specific location in France
- **Connection Line**: Dashed white line showing path between France and Poland
- **Subtle Context**: Other European landmasses visible through contour lines

### Typography and Content
- **Headings**: Large, bold white sans-serif font for "Brochures"
- **Body Text**: Clean white text explaining the map concept
- **Labels**: Clear country names ("Francja" for France, "Polska" for Poland)
- **High Contrast**: White text and outlines against dark teal background

### Information Architecture
- **Two-Section Layout**: Map (top two-thirds) and text (bottom third)
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Visual elements support the narrative
- **Contextual Information**: Text explains the map's purpose and inspiration
- **Treasure Map Aesthetic**: "X" marks the spot, dashed connection lines

## What You Like About This Design

### Key Preferences
- **Wireframe Map**: Clean, minimalist geographic representation
- **Areas of Interest Clearly Outlined**: Specific countries/regions highlighted with white borders
- **Annotated**: Clear text labels and markers for important locations
- **Technical Aesthetic**: Blueprint/treasure map style with contour lines
- **High Contrast**: White elements against dark teal background

### Design Principles to Apply
- Use wireframe outlines to clearly define geographic areas
- Highlight specific regions of interest with contrasting borders
- Add clear annotations and labels for important locations
- Maintain high contrast for readability
- Use subtle contour lines for texture and depth
- Include connection elements to show relationships between locations

## Application to Cirrus Project

### Potential Adaptations
- **Weather Map**: Wireframe outline of Canada with weather regions highlighted
- **Risk Areas**: Specific provinces or regions outlined for different weather risks
- **Weather Stations**: "X" markers for weather monitoring stations
- **Connection Lines**: Paths showing weather patterns or risk propagation

### Implementation Notes
- The wireframe style would work perfectly for weather maps
- Highlighted areas could represent different weather risk zones
- Annotations could show weather station locations or risk levels
- The dark teal background would provide excellent contrast for weather data
- The clean, technical aesthetic would appeal to professional users

### Weather-Specific Adaptations
- **Map Style**: Wireframe outline of Canada with provincial borders
- **Highlighted Areas**: 
  - Different provinces outlined for different weather types
  - Risk zones clearly defined with contrasting borders
  - Weather monitoring regions highlighted
- **Annotations**: 
  - Weather station locations marked with "X" or other symbols
  - Risk level labels for different areas
  - Weather type indicators (fire risk, flood risk, etc.)
- **Connection Elements**: 
  - Lines showing weather pattern movement
  - Risk propagation paths
  - Weather system trajectories
- **Color Scheme**: 
  - Dark teal or slate background
  - White outlines and text for high contrast
  - Subtle contour lines for geographic texture

### Technical Implementation
- **Custom Map Styling**: Leaflet with wireframe tile styling
- **Highlighted Regions**: Custom polygon overlays with contrasting borders
- **Annotations**: Custom markers and text labels
- **Contour Lines**: Subtle overlay for geographic texture
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure annotations remain readable on different screen sizes
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects for additional weather information
