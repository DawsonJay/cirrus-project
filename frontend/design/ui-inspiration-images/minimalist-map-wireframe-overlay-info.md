## Design Elements

### Visual Style
- **Background**: Dark, textured slate grey/black with subtle grid pattern
- **Map Outline**: Thin white lines creating clean wireframe borders
- **Monochrome Palette**: High contrast white on dark background
- **Blueprint Aesthetic**: Technical drawing style with clean, functional appearance

### Map Design
- **Geographic Outline**: Clear country/island borders in thin white lines
- **Internal Boundaries**: Prefectural/regional borders also outlined
- **Grid Overlay**: Subtle grid pattern for technical reference
- **Minimalist Approach**: Only essential geographic information shown

### Point of Interest System
- **Location Markers**: Small white circles marking specific locations
- **Connection Lines**: Thin white lines connecting markers to labels
- **Text Labels**: White text with both local and English names
- **Overlay UI**: Clean text box in top-left corner listing all locations

### Information Architecture
1. **Legend Box**: "PLACES PHOTOGRAPHED" header with location list
2. **Map Markers**: Six specific locations marked with circles and lines
3. **Bilingual Labels**: Japanese and English names for accessibility
4. **Clean Typography**: Simple, readable font for all text elements

## Application to Cirrus Project

### Potential Adaptations
- **Weather Map**: Could use similar wireframe style for Canadian provinces/territories
- **Risk Markers**: Highlight areas with weather risks using similar overlay system
- **Information Boxes**: Clean text overlays for weather data and alerts
- **Connection Lines**: Lines connecting weather stations or risk areas to data

### Implementation Notes
- The wireframe style would work perfectly for weather maps
- Point markers could show weather stations, risk areas, or active weather events
- Overlay UI could display weather data, risk levels, or alerts
- The technical aesthetic would appeal to professional users
- High contrast design ensures readability in various lighting conditions

### Weather-Specific Adaptations
- **Map Style**: Wireframe outline of Canada with provincial borders
- **Weather Markers**: Circles marking weather stations, risk areas, or active events
- **Data Overlays**: Clean text boxes showing temperature, humidity, risk levels
- **Connection Lines**: Lines connecting weather data to specific locations
- **Color Coding**: Could add subtle color overlays for different weather conditions
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover states for weather data and risk information

### Technical Implementation
- **Leaflet Integration**: Could customize Leaflet maps with wireframe styling
- **CSS Styling**: Custom map tiles or overlay styling for wireframe appearance
- **Data Visualization**: Overlay weather data using similar marker and line system
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure overlay UI works on different screen sizes
